However, if you must pursue this hopeless quest, you should understand that Vogons will go through a great deal of trouble to avoid doing anything so simple. They will bury the plans in the basement of a file storage facility, in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘Beware of the Leopard. ’ They will bury it under peat, lose it, find it again, and bury it under concrete. They will lose it again, find it a third time, and finally hide it in the most obscure possible location, all to ensure that no one ever finds it and that they never have to actually go to the effort of giving you that drink of water. ” -Douglas AdamsHitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy linkedingithubcredly "
