<p>“Here is what to do if you want to get a drink of water from a Vogon: the first thing you must realize is that a Vogon is as likely to give you a drink of water as he is to provide you with directions to a restroom, i.e., not at all likely. However, if you must pursue this hopeless quest, you should understand that Vogons will go through a great deal of trouble to avoid doing anything so simple. They will bury the plans in the basement of a file storage facility, in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘Beware of the Leopard.’ They will bury it under peat, lose it, find it again, and bury it under concrete. They will lose it again, find it a third time, and finally hide it in the most obscure possible location, all to ensure that no one ever finds it and that they never have to actually go to the effort of giving you that drink of water.”</p>

I will document various projects and share detailed instructions. My first goal is to create a testing lab on AWS, complete with step-by-step directions and a Terraform script for easy replication. This will be a resource for anyone interested in setting up a similar environment.</p>

<p>In this space, I will analyze and detonate malware, walk through scripts and code I develop, host my resume, discuss my certification studies, and review different attacks I encounter daily as a security analyst. Join me as I explore and share insights in the field of cybersecurity.</p>
