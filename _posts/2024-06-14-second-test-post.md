This is a second post to see what it will look like on the main page. 

"Here is what to do if you want to get a drink of water from a Vogon: the first thing you must realize is that a Vogon is as likely to give you a drink of water as he is to provide you with directions to a restroom, i.e., not at all likely. However, if you must pursue this hopeless quest, you should understand that Vogons will go through a great deal of trouble to avoid doing anything so simple. They will bury the plans in the basement of a file storage facility, in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of the Leopard.' They will bury it under peat, lose it, find it again, and bury it under concrete. They will lose it again, find it a third time, and finally hide it in the most obscure possible location, all to ensure that no one ever finds it and that they never have to actually go to the effort of giving you that drink of water."
