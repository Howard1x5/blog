        <p>Welcome to my security blog. I will document various projects and share detailed instructions. My first goal is to create a testing lab on AWS, complete with step-by-step directions and a Terraform script for easy replication. This will be a resource for anyone interested in setting up a similar environment.</p>
        <p>In this space, I will analyze and detonate malware, walk through scripts and code I develop, host my resume, discuss my certification studies, and review different attacks I encounter daily as a security analyst. Join me as I explore and share insights in the field of cybersecurity.</p>
